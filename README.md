emacs.d
=======

A collection of my emacs settings, tuned for Emacs 24.3 and higher.

Setup
=====

* Link this repository to ~/.emacs.d
* The first time you launch it will require an active internet connection to fetch all the necessary packages
* For python, jedi-mode requires additional configuration, but is so worth it:

```
pip install jedi epc
```

* Likewise, for Ruby, robe-mode requires additional configuration:

``
gem install pry pry-doc
``
